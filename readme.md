Explanation of the Updated Code:
Abstract Class 'Item': This base class remains unchanged and 
continues to define common properties and methods for items.

Classes 'Book' and 'AudioBook': These classes extend Item and 
provide specific implementations for books and audiobooks.

Class Library:

The displayAvailableItems method now takes an itemType parameter, 
allowing it to filter and display only books or audiobooks based on user input.
Class LibraryRentalSystem:

The menu options allow users to view available books and audiobooks separately.
Users can still rent and return items as before.

How to Use:
Compile and run the program.
Follow the on-screen instructions to view available items, rent, or return items.
The user can now choose between viewing books or audiobooks, enhancing the interactivity of the rental system.
